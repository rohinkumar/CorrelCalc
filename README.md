# correlcalc
A Python package to calculate 2-point correlation function(2pCF) from galaxy redshift surveys for any generic model of Cosmology or geometry

Using this package one can also calculate anisotropic 2pCF for different models of Cosmology.

Usage of the package is presented in separate notebooks in correlcalc-nb repo
