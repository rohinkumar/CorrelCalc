# correlcalc
A Python package to calculate 2-point correlation function(2pCF) from galaxy redshift surveys for any generic model of Cosmology or geometry.

The algorithm and formulae used are presented in the paper entitled **A `Generic' Recipe for Quick Computation of Two-point Correlation function**

It is available on arXiv:1710.01723 at  https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01723.

Please cite the same if you use this package or the 'recipe' presented herein

Using this package one can also calculate anisotropic 2pCF for different models of Cosmology.

Usage of the package is given in jupyter notebook "Using correlcalc example.nb" and in main.py 

To install the package Download this git repositry and in terminal enter the folder that contains setup.py and type "pip install ."
